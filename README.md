# KnapsackSolver

The 0-1 Knapsack Problem:
Given a collection of items, each with a weight and a value and an overall maximum capacity constraint, we want to select a number of items such that the sum of weights of each item do not exceed the capacity but the values of items are maximized. 

The program takes in an input file containing three lines. The first line contains the number of items and the capacity constraint. The second line contains the weight of each item and the third line contains the value of each item.
